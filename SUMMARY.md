**Road Pothole Images for Pothole Detection** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the automotive industry, and in the engineering research. 

The dataset consists of 11497 images with 7588 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*pothole*).

Images in the Road Pothole Images dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 8552 (74% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 4 splits in the dataset: *ds1_simplex-test* (277 images), *ds2_complex-test* (604 images), *ds1_simplex-train* (3126 images), and *ds2_complex-train* (7490 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 training subsets: ***negative data*** (8608 images) and ***positive data*** (2008 images). Additionaly, the ***pothole numbers*** data is available. The dataset was released in 2018 by the Stellenbosch University, South Africa.
