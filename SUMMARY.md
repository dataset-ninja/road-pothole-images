**Road Pothole Images for Pothole Detection** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the engineering research. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 11497 images with 7588 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*pothole*).

Images in the Road Pothole Images dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 8552 (74% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 4 splits in the dataset: *ds1-simplex-test* (277 images), *ds1-simplex-train* (3126 images), *ds2-complex-test* (604 images), and *ds2-complex-train* (7490 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 training subsets: ***negative data*** (0 images) and ***positive data*** (0 images). Additionaly, the ***pothole numbers*** data is available. The dataset was released in 2018 by the Stellenbosch University, South Africa.
